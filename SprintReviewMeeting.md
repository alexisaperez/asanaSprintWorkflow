# Sprint review meeting

## Goal

The goal of each sprint is to deliver a potentially shippable product or increment. This means that at the end of each sprint, the team has produced coded and tested deliverables. The goal of the review is to verify each story (tasks) within the sprint is complete and settles the criteria of the product owner.

## How

At the end of each sprint, a sprint review meeting is held. During the review meeting, the Scrum team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically this takes the form of a demo of the new features or deliverables.

## Style

The sprint review meeting is informal, typically no PowerPoint slides or other staged materials. Each team member should take no more than a couple hours if any time at all to prepare for the meeting. A sprint review meeting should not become a distraction or significant detour for the team; rather, it should be a natural result of the sprint.

## Who

Participants in the sprint review typically include the product owner, the Scrum team, the ScrumMaster, management, and occasionally customers.

## Outcome

During the sprint review, the project is assessed against the sprint goals determined during the sprint planning meeting. Ideally, the team has completed each product backlog item brought into the sprint, but it's more important that they achieve the overall goal of the sprint collaboratively. If items is are not complete the status is reviewed, updated, and added back to the backlog for a future sprint.
